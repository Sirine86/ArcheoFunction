# ArcheoFunction
A function to use by archeologist to save their information into map 

**Getting start:** 
We start by downloading some software onto our computer which support the function work. 
In addition, it’s useful to read and get some information about phyton language and its packages. 


**Anaconda navigator:** It’s a desktop graphical user interface (GUI), that allows us to launch application 
and manage Conda packages, it’s a distribution of the Phyton and programing languages for scientific computing. 
It can be downloaded onto any types of computers by following the link Installation — Anaconda documentation and 
choose your type of pc. The steps are very clear, you have only to follow them. Then, we have to create a 
Conda environment which is a directory contains all packages you have to install. The one we are interested in,
is the PyCharm community edition which is an integrated development environment (IDE) that helps us in programing,
through it we can write our script and save it into (.py) phyton extension. 

**GitHub:** Git is a version control software that helps to track changes in files,
enabling you to work collaboratively on code (or other projects) and share code.
You have to create an account on https://github.com/ where you can create your own project and repository, 
and to access to ArcheoCode function’s files and script. 
You have to install git by following the steps on https://git-scm.com/downloads, 
it’s important to fork or copy-paste the repository of ArcheoCode onto your computer. It’s also very useful to
download GitHub desktop which is a graphical user interface and enable you to push (upload) and pull (download) 
changes to/from remote repositories. It can be downloaded on window and Mac through https://desktop.github.com/,
you have to login onto your account through File>option>account. Once you’ve finishing all requires, 
you can clone repository (past folder) and start explore the function. 

**PyCharm:**
once we have all the requires to start using the function, you have to open the PyCharm community 
and move to the file of script which is located in the same folder of repository. Be sure and take attention to 
read each command and try to understand what each one means, the comments which is following the sign ‘##’ explain
each function and command do with identifying each parameter.

**Function:** it is written by Phyton language with the use of conda package as cartopy,
matplotlib and geopandas for making maps. Vector layers are defined and import from branch Map of repository,
and site location is defined by the coordinate system. 

**Branches:** there are three branches created on GitHub desktop for the Archeo Function repository. 
Those branches (DataBase_1, Sites_location and Vector_data) contain data used in the script, where it’s necessary 
to merge them into the main branch where you are able to use and edit them.
